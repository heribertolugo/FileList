    /// <list type="number">
    /// <item><description>
    /// Queries the object for a pointer to the IMarshal interface. If the object does not implement IMarshal, meaning that it relies on COM to provide marshaling support, CoMarshalInterface gets a pointer to COM's default implementation of IMarshal.

Calling IMarshal directly from your proxy and stub code is not recommended.
    /// If you are writing your own implementation of IMarshal, and your proxy needs access to a private object, you can include an interface pointer to that object as part of the data you write to the stream.In such situations, if you want to use COM's default marshaling implementation when passing the interface pointer, you can call CoMarshalInterface on the object to do so.
